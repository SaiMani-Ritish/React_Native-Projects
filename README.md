# CS624-PE-Sai_Mani_Ritish

## Input

Since this app only displays text of my name, degree program, and university and it is static there is no input method.

## Process

In this app the main function renders a 'View' component with the styling of a yellow background. 
I've used three Text components that display static strings. And the StyleSheet defines styling in the container and for the text. Expo is used to run a React Native framework on a mobile device or web.

## Output

As for the output the application will display the information of my name, program and the university name with a yellow background all centered.
- U Sai Mani Ritish
- MSCS 
- City University of Seattle

The output is viewd in the web or in the 'Expo Go' mobile application.
