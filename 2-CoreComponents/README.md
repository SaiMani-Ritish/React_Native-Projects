## PE02 - Core Components 
MSCS Courses

### Input
This time, this app allows the user to enter their favorite course in the Text Box. And I added CityU's logo image to the local assets folder as 'icon.png', and it loaded from there.

### Process
I built this app using a functional component written with an arrow function. It uses the React Native core components, including View, Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet, as per the requirements for this assignment. The ScrollView ensures the screen is scrollable. All course names are stored in arrays and rendered with the map function.

### Output
The app displays an image, a title, an input field, and a scrollable list of MSCS courses. The userâ€™s input is shown on the screen. I walked around with the internal styles used for layout, spacing, and colors to make the UI visually clear.
