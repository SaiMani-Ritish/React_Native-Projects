# CS624-PE-Sai_Mani_Ritish

## PE01 - Hello World

### Input

Since this app only displays the text of my name, program, and university, and it is static, so there is no input method.

### Process

In this app, the main function renders a 'View' component with the styling of a yellow background. 
I've used three Text components that display static strings. And the StyleSheet defines styling in the container and for the text. Expo is used to run a React Native framework on a mobile device or web.

### Output

As for the output the application will display the information of my name, program, and university name with a yellow background all centered.
- U Sai Mani Ritish
- MSCS 
- City University of Seattle

The output is viewed on the web or in the 'Expo Go' mobile application.

### Get started by

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
